## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sagaspice.git

This will start a local development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website locally.

## Build and Deployment

To build the project for production, follow these steps:

### 1. Build the production version

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory.

### 2. Deploy the build

Once the build is complete, you can deploy the `dist` folder to a hosting service like **Netlify**. You can follow these steps to deploy it:

- Push the changes to your GitHub repository.
- Connect your GitHub repository to **Netlify** for continuous deployment.
- In the **Netlify** dashboard, ensure that the correct branch (`master`) is selected for deployment.

### 3. Preview the production build locally

To preview the production build locally, run the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will allow you to test the production build before deploying it.

## Available Scripts

- **dev**: Starts the development server using Vite for fast live-reloading during development.
- **build**: Builds the project for production, optimizing assets and compiling files.
- **lint**: Lints the codebase using ESLint to ensure consistent coding standards and avoid errors.
- **preview**: Previews the production build locally before deployment.
